# arduino-led-sequence-v1
This project demonstrates how to control multiple LEDs sequentially using an Arduino. Three LEDs connected to pins 7, 4, and 8 turn on one by one, stay on for a fixed time, and then turn off before the next LED turns on.  The program uses an array and a loop to avoid repeating code and to make it easy to modify later.
